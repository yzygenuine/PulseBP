            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p class="last-updated">Last updated: September 22, 2025</p>

            <p>This Privacy Policy explains how PulseBP (“we”, “us”, or “our”) handles information when you use the PulseBP mobile application (the “App” or the “Service”).</p>
            <p>PulseBP is designed to help you record and track your blood pressure and heart rate, view trends, set reminders, and export your records. We prioritize your privacy and keep your health data on your device by default.</p>

            <h2>Key Points</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>No account is required to use PulseBP.</li>
                <li>We do not upload your blood pressure or heart rate data to our servers; your health data is stored locally on your device unless you explicitly export or share it.</li>
                <li>We do not use in-app advertising or third-party analytics by default.</li>
                <li>Notifications are used solely to deliver measurement and medication reminders if you enable them.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Information We Handle</h2>
            <h3>Health Data You Enter</h3>
            <p>The App allows you to record health information such as blood pressure and heart rate. This data stays on your device and is used to display records, charts, and trends.</p>

            <h3>Permissions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> With your permission, we use local notifications to remind you about measurements and medications. You can change these permissions at any time in your device settings.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Export and Sharing</h3>
            <p>You may choose to export your data (e.g., as a file or through share options) to send it to healthcare providers or family members. Exports are initiated solely by you. After export, the handling of that copy is your responsibility.</p>

            <h2>What We Do Not Collect</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>We do not collect your health data on our servers.</li>
                <li>We do not collect personally identifiable information (such as name, email, address) unless you directly contact us.</li>
                <li>We do not use third‑party advertising SDKs or analytics SDKs by default.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Use of Information</h2>
            <p>Information on your device is used by the App to provide core features such as record keeping, trend charts, reminders, and data export. If you contact us for support and share information with us, we will use it only to respond to your inquiry.</p>

            <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
            <p>Your health data is stored locally on your device. Please protect your device with a passcode and keep your operating system updated. If you delete the App or your device data, your locally stored records may be permanently lost unless you have created your own backups or exports.</p>

            <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
            <p>The App is not directed to children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will address it promptly.</p>

            <h2>International Use</h2>
            <p>Your use of the App may be subject to privacy and health data regulations in your region. We do not transfer your health data to our servers. If you choose to export data, that exported copy may be processed by services of your choice according to their terms and privacy policies.</p>

            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Material changes will be reflected by updating the “Last updated” date above and publishing the updated policy in the App resources or website.</p>

                <h3>Sale of Personal Information of Minors Under 16 Years of Age</h3>
                <p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors under the age of 16 through our Service, although certain third party websites that we link to may do so. These third-party websites have their own terms of use and privacy policies and we encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and instruct their children to never provide information on other websites without their permission.</p>
                <p>We do not sell the personal information of Consumers We actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless We receive affirmative authorization (the "right to opt-in") from either the Consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a Consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to the sale of personal information may opt-out of future sales at any time. To exercise the right to opt-out, You (or Your authorized representative) may submit a request to Us by contacting Us.</p>

            <p class="last-updated">Last updated: September 22, 2025</p>

            <h2>Agreement to Terms</h2>
            <p>By downloading, installing, or using the PulseBP mobile application ("Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you disagree with any part of these terms, then you may not access the Service.</p>

            <h2>Description of Service</h2>
            <p>PulseBP helps users record and track blood pressure and heart rate, view trends, set reminders, and export health records. The App does not provide medical diagnosis or treatment.</p>

            <h2>Important Health Disclaimer</h2>
            <div class="important-notice">
                <h3>⚠️ Not Medical Advice</h3>
                <p>PulseBP is intended for wellness and informational purposes only and is not a medical device. It does not diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. Always consult a qualified healthcare professional for medical advice. Never disregard professional medical advice or delay seeking it because of something you read in the App.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>User Responsibilities</h2>
            <ul>

            <p>Your privacy is important to us. Please review our <a href="privacy_policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, which explains how the App handles information. In short: your health data is stored locally on your device unless you choose to export or share it.</p>

            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>The App may link to or allow you to interact with third-party services (for example, email or file apps you use to export data). Those services are governed by their own terms and privacy policies.</p>

            <h2>Disclaimers</h2>
            <p>The Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free.</p>

            <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event shall the PulseBP owner, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from or relating to your use of the Service.</p>

            <h2>Indemnification</h2>

            <h2>Termination</h2>
            <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the Service will cease immediately.</p>
